<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Sumitava Banerjee — a passionate and skilled Full-Stack Web Developer with a B.Tech in Computer Engineering. I specialize in crafting websites that don’t just look great but also work flawlessly across all devices.
</p>
<p>From front-end design to back-end development, I build user-friendly, responsive, and high-performance websites that help businesses grow. I pay close attention to mobile optimization, user experience (UX), and aesthetic appeal, ensuring every site I create is intuitive, fast, and aligned with modern web standards.
</p>
<p>I also take care of ongoing website maintenance, updates, and optimizations to ensure your digital presence remains strong and impactful over time.
</p>
<p>In addition to full-stack development, I have a solid command of Python, which allows me to work on automation, backend services, data handling, and more.
</p>
<p>Whether you’re starting from scratch or revamping an existing site, I bring a thoughtful, strategic, and creative approach to every project I take on.</p>
